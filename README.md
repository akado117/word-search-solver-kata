This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Using TDD based upon Pillars approach, every class will be built step by step allowing tests to drive majority of functional architecture. Test file are denoted with .test.js and will be siblings to the classes they test. This makes it much simpler to import and maintain when changes are made.
